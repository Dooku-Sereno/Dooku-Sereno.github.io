            <h2 class = "maintitle">Cara Dunes former actor, Gina Carano, is perusing Disney</h2>
            <div class="main"><p>You will likely see that I use "{…}" to encompass large quotes, particularly sections from other articles that include quotes (so it isn't so cluttered and messy with all the quotation marks next to each other.</p>
                <h3>Background information:</h3>
                <p>Gina Carano is a former MMA fighter who played Cara (Carasynthia is her full first name, apparently) Dune in The Mandalorian, Disney & Lucasfilm (owned by Disney). She debuted in "Chapter 4: Sanctuary," which aired on November 29, 2019. She made her final appearance in ""Chapter 16: The Rescue," which aired on December 18, 2020, with a total of seven appearances in the show (0).</p>
                <p>The main kerfuffle occurred with her Instagram post on February 10, 2024, which started a "#FireGinaCarano." This resulted in "{a spokesperson with the production company said in a statement on Wednesday [February 10*] that Carano is not currently employed by Lucasfilm with "no plans for her to be in the future." "Nevertheless, her social media posts denigrating people based on their cultural and religious identities are abhorrent and unacceptable," the statement read"}" (PBS). Wookieepedia states, "On February 10, 2021, Lucasfilm issued a statement via multiple media outlets regarding Carano's employment with them," and provides a link to Gizmodo's "Gina Carano Is No Longer a Part of Star Wars."</p>
                <p>Multiple articles bring up points of Carano's previous comments (and likes). "{"We need to clean up the election process so we are not left feeling the way we do today," Carano said two days after the November 3 vote}" (NPR); Carano later posts that she either way with all the misinformation going around. (1) Carano "{had been criticized for social media posts that mocked mask wearing during the pandemic and alleged voter fraud during the 2020 presidential election. She also mocked the use of gender pronouns, listing "beep/bop/boop" in her social media bio}" (PBS). Carano later tries to defend this with her (more) recent post on X (formerly Twitter), "{Look at why I was called a transphobe--for making droid noises from Star Wars? "Beep, bop, boop" was directed to the online bullies and did not in any way denigrate transgender people}" (2). Interestingly, in her announcement post about her lawsuit against Disney/Lucasfilm, she responds to one of her previously (controversial) actions that Disney/Lucasfilm never acknowledged, responded to, or, most importantly, fired her for. She also states that her post was "obviously" not transphobe and tries to pose as the victim (of online hate (and cancel culture) and being fired).</p>
                <p>While Disney/Lucasfilm did not publicly respond or acknowledge her previous posts, it could be a contributing factor. Gizmodo states that the #FireGineCarano trend "{came after months of complaints about Carano's online presence, including mocking covid mask mandates, spreading conspiracies about the United States election, liking posts disparaging the Black Lives Matter movement, and mocking pronoun}" (Gizmodo). Her previous response to her pronouns kerfuffle was in 2020, where she said she is "not against trans lives at all. They need to find less abusive representation," where she also says she was being harassed for three months in "every way" before writing "beep/bop/boop" as her pronouns in her "bio" (2) "{She also jumped in on another conspiracy theory, over the suicide of pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, posting Wednesday a square full of letters containing the message, "Jeff Epstein didnt kill himself"}" (NYP). One interpretation of her influential (it influenced her getting fired) post on her Twitter was that she was "implying that being a Republican today is like being Jewish during the Holocaust" (Parker and Couch).</p>
                <h2>Gina Carano's attempts to create a lawsuit against Disney</h2>
                <p>"{LOS ANGELES (AP) — Actor Gina Carano on Tuesday sued Lucasfilm and its parent The Walt Disney Co. over her 2021 firing from "The Mandalorian," saying she was let go for expressing right-wing views on social media.}" (AD)</p>
                <p>"{The lawsuit Carano filed with help from X, formerly Twitter, in federal court in California alleges her wrongful termination from the "Star Wars" galaxy Disney+ streaming series after two seasons over a post likening the treatment of American conservatives to the treatment of Jews in Nazi Germany.}" (AD)</p>
                <p>"{The lawsuit alleges she was fired because she "dared voice her own opinions" against an "online bully mob who demanded her compliance with their extreme progressive ideology.}”(AD)</p>
                <p>In her Tweet/X post about the lawsuit (Carano Court Tweet 0), she references Elon Musk's tweet about funding a legal bill to sue the employer*** (Elon Musk's Tweet)</p>
                <p>On July 24, 2024, Gina Carano posts an update about her case. She states, "What happened to me was unacceptable, absurd, and abusive, among other things. It should not have happened to me, and it should not happen to anyone else moving forward" (Carano Court Tweet 1).</p>
                <p>On October 17, 2024, Gina Carano posts an update about her case. She states, "After the Judge DENIED Disneys request to DISMISS my case, Disney requested permission to immediately appeal that decision to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and delay all discovery while that appeal takes place." And that she is "obviously very pleased" (Carano Court Tweet 2).</p>

                <p>**: determined by the byline containing "AP" after a name, "ANDREW DALTON AP."</p>
                <p>***: As someone who is not a lawyer and isn't informed in this area, I am confused by the terminology used, and I believe it is implied that the "legal bill" is for 'suing' the previous employer.'</p></div>
